Dear, WTF put @ replies from people not on my follower list back. How does one expand their social network like this? BAH.  LAME.
I was really shocked to see Danny go.... He was my pick from the very beginning
is wondering what to do with the laptop on life support at home, while on a trip to San Angelo. I guess it'll be a lack of internet.
My husband just left american idol...
I took a long nap and now I can't go back to sleep! and I might not be able to pass english.
sleep. have to wake up at 5 to be at the airport at 6...ahhh. Then Chicago `til Sunday. Please pray for our flights - I hate flying!
Tell me, How could Alison lose!

It's Adam's looks that makes me go ech, tbh  He has a great voice but he presents himself really badly, imo.

Dear, WTF put @ replies from people not on my follower list back. How does one expand their social network like this? BAH.  LAME.
I was really shocked to see Danny go.... He was my pick from the very beginning
is wondering what to do with the laptop on life support at home, while on a trip to San Angelo. I guess it'll be a lack of internet.
My husband just left american idol...
I took a long nap and now I can't go back to sleep! and I might not be able to pass english.

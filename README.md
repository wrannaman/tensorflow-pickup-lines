# Code for the Recurrent Neural Network in the presentation "Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD, Part 2"

The presentation itself is available here:

This sample has now been updated for Tensorflow 1.1. Please make sure you redownload the checkpoint files if you use rnn_play.py.

## Usage:

```
> python3 rnn_train.py
```
The script **rnn_train.py** trains a language model on the complete works of William Shakespeare.
You can also train on Tensorflow Python code. See comments in the file.

The file **rnn_train_stateistuple.py** implements the same model using
the state_is_tuple=True option in tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell (default).
Training is supposedly faster (by ~10%) but handling the state as
a tuple is a bit more cumbersome.

```
> tensorboard --logdir=log
```
The training script **rnn_train.py** is set up to save training and validation
data as "Tensorboard sumaries" in the "log" folder. They can be visualised with Tensorboard.
In the screenshot below, you can see the RNN being trained on 6 epochs of Shakespeare.
The training and valisation curves stay close together which means that overfitting is not a major issue here.
 You can try to add some dropout (pkeep=0.8 for example) but it will not improve the situation much becasue it is already quite good.

```
> python3 rnn_play.py
```

The script **rnn_play.py** uses a trained checkpoint to generate a new "Shakespeare" play.  
You can also generate new "Tensorflow Python" code. See comments in the file.

Checkpoint files can be downloaded from here:  

[Fully trained](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5njS_LX6IsDc2lWTmtyanRpOHc/view?usp=sharing)
on Shakespeare or Tensorflow Python source.   

[Partially trained](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5njS_LX6IsDUlFsMkdhclNSazA/view?usp=sharing)
to see how they make progress in training.

```
> python3 -m unittest tests.py
```
Unit tests can be run with the command above.

## FAQ

### 1) Why not apply a softmax activation function to the outputs of the LSTM directly?
That is because you need to convert vectors of size CELLSIZE to size ALPHASIZE.
The reduction of dimensions is best performed by a learned layer.

###  Why does it not work with just one cell? The RNN cell state should still enable state transitions, even without unrolling ?
Yes, a cell is a state machine and can represent state transitions like
the fact that an there is a pending open parenthesis and that it will need
to be closed at some point. The problem is to make the network learn those
transitions. The learning algorithm only modifies weights and biases. The input
state of the cell cannot be modified by it: that is a big problem if the wrong
predictions returned by the cell are caused by a bad input state. The solution
is to unroll the cell into a sequence of replicas. Now the learning algorithm
can change the weights and biases to influence the state flowing from one cell
in the sequence to the next (with the exception of the input state of the first
cell)

###  3) OK, so this trained model will only be able to generate state transitions over a distance equal to the number of cells in an unrolled sequence, right ?
No, it will be able to *learn* state transitions over that distance only.
However, when we will use the model to generate text, it will be able to produce
correct state transitions over longer distances. For example, if the unrolling
size is 30, the model will be able to correctly open and close parentheses over
distances of 100 characters or more. But you will have to teach it this trick
using examples of 30 or less characters.

###  4) So, now that I have unrolled the RNN cell, state passing is taken care of. I just have to call my train_step in a loop right ?
Not quite, you still need to save the last state of the unrolled sequence of
cells, and feed it as the input state for the next minibatch in the traing loop.

### 5) What is the proper way of batching training sequences ?
All the character sequences in the first batch, must continue in the second
batch and so on, because all the output states produced by the sequences in the
first batch will be used as input states for the sequences of the second batch.
txt.rnn_minibatch_sequencer is a utility provided for this purpose.
It even continues sequences from one epoch to the next (apart from one sequence
in the last batch of the epoch: the one where the training text finishes. There
is no way to continue that one.) So there is no need to reset the state between
epochs. The training will see at most one incoherent state per epoch, which is
negligible.

### 6) What is the proper way of applying dropout in an RNN ?
Dropout in RNN theory is described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2329.pdf<br/>
and further developed here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05287.pdf<br/>

The first thing to understand is that dropout can be applied to either the inputs of the outputs
of a dense layer and this does not make much difference. If you look at the weights matrix of a
dense neural network layer ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TVixw6ItiZ8igjp6U17tcgoFrLSaHWQmMOwjlgQY9co/pub?slide=id.g110257a6da_0_431))
you realize that applying dropout to inputs is equivalent to dropping lines in the weights matrix
whereas applyting dropout to outputs is equivalent to dropping columns in the weights matrix. You might
use a different dropout ratio for one and the other if your columns are significantly larger than
your lines but that is  the only difference.

In RNNs it is customary to add dropout to inputs in all cell layers as well as the output of the last layer,
which actually serves as the input dropout of the softmax layer so there is no need to add that explicitly.

The first article says that dropout should be applied to RNN inputs+output but not states. In this approach,
a random dropout mask is recomputed at every step of the unrolled sequence. This approach is called "naive dropout"
and it's the one implemented in this sample.

The second article says that dropout should be applied to RNN inputs+output as well as states,
using the same dropout mask for all the steps of the unrolled sequence. This approach is called "variational dropout"
and the primitives for implementing it have recently been added to Tensorflow.

In the Shakespeare example, dropout (pkeep=0.8) can fix a slight tendency for overfitting visible between 10 and 20 training epochs.

### 7) Any other gotcha's ?
When saving and restoring the model, you must name your placeholders and name
your nodes if you want to target them by name in the restored version (when you
run a session.run([-nodes-], feed_dict={-placeholders-}) using the restored model.

### 8) This is not serious. I want more math!
If you want to go deeper in the math, the one piece you are missing is the explanation
of retropropagation, i.e. the algorithm used to compute gradients across multiple layers
of neurons. Google it! It's useful if you want to re-implement gradient descent on your
own, or understand how it is done. And it's not that hard. If the explanations do not make
sense to you, it's probably because the explanations are bad. Google more :-)

The second piece of math I would advise you to read on is the math behind "sampled softmax"
in RNNs. You need to write down the softmax equations, the loss functions, derive it, and
then try to devise cheap ways of approximating this gradient. This is an [active area of
research](http://sebastianruder.com/word-embeddings-softmax/index.html).

The third interesting piece of mathematics is to understand why LSTMs converge while RNNs built with basic
RNN blocks do not.

Good mathematical hunting!ï»¿

    That works out of this fearful sore of feather

    That have some men of man is now the subject.
    What says the story, well say we have said to thee,
    That shall she not, though that the way of hearts,
    We have seen his service that we may be sad.

    But, sir, you shall have such a sweet air from the state,
    There is not so much as you see the store,
    As if the base should be so foul as you.

DOMITIUS ENOY
